                <p>1) when adding projects or events you can leave your referral link and get a large number of referrals especially if the project hits the TOP Events</p>
                <img class="imgSize" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/catcheckorg-34caf.appspot.com/o/imagesFAQ%2Fhow-to-make-money-on-the-catcheck.webp?alt=media&token=07e065dd-3c47-4472-b97b-f12047a94961" alt="add link and discription">
                <p>2) When adding projects, you can add a link to guides, articles and videos on any of your social media accounts and web-sites to the description, thus you will get traffic to your resources. We can update the content if we find more quality content. Perhaps, in the future we will pay tokens for writing articles</p>

                <p>3) For every action on the web-site: 
                - adding a token, and its events :<br>
                - presale,<br>

                for each of the actions above you get catch points, these points can be exchanged for catch tokens.
                Now testnet is going on, after the pre-sale of token and listing we will pay all testers CATCH tokens, 
                which will be embedded in project tokenomics, the more you earn points the more you get tokens, our goal is to 
                reward all project supporters at the start with big payouts and use thus viral marketing, which 
                <a href="https://uniswap.org/" title="uniswap.org" target="_blank">uniswap</a>, <a href="https://app.1inch.io/" title="1inch.io" target="_blank">1inch</a>, 
                <a href="https://godsunchained.com/" title="godsunchained.com" target="_blank">gods unchained</a> and other projects used, in return we will 
                get traffic and users, practice showed that for working 
                products this is good strategy.  But please understand we are not promising anything specifically, it all depends 
                on what funds will invest in us in the early stages of 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presales#:~:text=Presales%20is%20a%20process%20or,is%20delivered%20to%20the%20customer." title="wikipedia.org" target="_blank">pre-sales</a>
                and other factors when choosing a development 
                strategy for the project, now we are looking for and negotiating strategic partnerships, anyway, our main goal is 
                to pay those who work on the web-site, our community and we are one team.
                </p>
                <p>After the listings, the points accumulated for each month of your work, we will sum up in % ratio and pay catch 
                tokens earned for the previous month, we will take tokens CATCH from the sale of advertising and other services 
                on the web-site (as well as for a good start, probably put additional rewards in tokenomics), after the payment 
                of tokens once a month points will be reset.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>ATTENTION, IF YOU DO NOT VISIT THE WEB-SITE, THE POINTS WILL BE TAKEN AWAY</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>4) There will be a ranking system on the web-site, maybe we will give all early and active users 
                high ranks after listing, the higher your rank the higher the payout of CATCH tokens. Also, if 
                you have a high rank you will be able to get tickets to participate in public sales on our 
                CATCHPAD Launchpad.
                </p>
                <p>5) Every project event on the web-site has the potential to get profit</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>presale you can find and buy token at presale stage and resell tokens or nft profitably after listing on exchanges.</li>
                    <li>whitelist entry in pre-sale stage, if you do not have money to invest you can sell won place ( investment opportunity allocation) 
                        on OTC market, we plan to make this market on our website.</li>
                    <li>airdrop free cryptocurrency giveaway, usually for uncomplicated actions in social media</li>
                    <li>bounty will suit Influencers, designers . You promote and advertise the project, in return you get tokens of 
                        the project, or the opportunity to buy tokens of the project allocation). If you are a good Influencer 
                        with a large audience, then big money and interesting projects await you</li>
                    <li>testing of cryptoproject product, maintaining the node (modern mining), testing demo, alpha version of the game, 
                        application testing , testing SWAP, cross-chain DEFI projects and any other testing of crypto products , 
                        in return you can be paid very big sums in the project tokens</li>
                    <li>refferal programs, which you can promote by inviting users to the already working project, you can be paid 
                        with % of income on a permanent basis or one-time payments</li>
                    <li>farming is staking or adding tokens to the liquidity pool to generate income, very similar to a deposit in a bank, 
                        it requires your own investment</li>

            <p>Catcheck is token event aggregator site, similar to wikipedia, where each user or project owner can 
            add token and its events: presale, whitelist, airdrop, bounty(ambassador), testnet,refferal, farming.
            </p>
            <p>When adding a token or adding an event on the main page of the web-site, the user can add their 
            referral link in any section of the token or report that the event is over, as well as to vote 
            for a token, open a dispute about whether the event is top or not ( this means that it will probably 
            give a lot of money).
            </p>
            <p>In addition to the ability to add referral links to any section of the project, users get CATCH 
            points for the above activities on the web-site. In case the web-site works perfectly after the 
            testnet and listing, catch points at the end of each month will be exchanged to CATCH tokens, 
            catch tokens will be taken from the sale of services on the web-site. The more catch points you 
            accumulate, the higher your account rank will be, the higher your account rank, the higher the 
            ratio and the higher the payout of CATCH tokens, as well as more tickets for lotteries of places 
            (allocations) in our catchpad public sales.

              VOTES takes into account the % of likes and dislikes, so new projects can easily make it to the top (% entry is affected by the emoji column, if the project has top 
              foundations and celebrities in the team it is easier to get a high %, but if the projects is suspected to be a scam the weight of dislikes will be much higher) now 
              the ordinary vote counting system is used and there is no emoji column

            <p>In the first phase of the testnet, we will add power and adjust the functioning of all 
            the nodes of the site, adjust the functioning of the web-site without bugs, as well as 
            add a referral program and launch our secret product.

            <p>
            Please note: Due to the imperfect operation of the system of charges and changes in the 
            terms of scoring, in the first phase of testing we will periodically reset your earned points, 
            we will save the database with your points and then after the launch of the main model, charging 
            points and power, we will give you all the fair amount of catch points as a percentage of all 
            previous updates.

            <p>
            Also we want to pay attention that all referral links on the web-site are yours, if you add a 
            project with your referral link in TOP Events, you will get a lot of referrals from your link.

            Get from 100 to 10 000 points per video (depends on views), according to our estimates it is about $10-$100, 
            but this is rough and not accurate, since we are now making strategic partnerships and in the process of making 
            our tokenomics and plans, but as we said we believe that giving out large sums at the start of the project like
            UNISWAP, 1INCH, GODS UNCHAINED will give viral marketing and coverage. But we can not promise anything for 100%, 
            the marketing strategy and tokenomics are in development so the payouts may be much lower, or much higher than announced.<br>

          2) When adding projects, you can add a link to guides, articles and videos on any of your social media accounts and web-sites to the description, thus you will get traffic to your resources. We can update the content if we find more quality content. Perhaps, in the future we will pay tokens for writing articles</p>
          3) For every action on the web-site: 
            - adding a token, and its events :
            - presale,
            - whitelist,
            - airdrop,
            - bounty,
            - testing,
            - referral,
            - farming,
            - for voting, for updating the information: indicate that the project is or is not a TOP Events,
            - report the end of any event
            For each of the actions above you get catch points, these points can be exchanged for catch tokens.
             Now testnet is going on, after the pre-sale of token and listing we will pay all testers CATCH tokens, 
             which will be embedded in project tokenomics, the more you earn points the more you get tokens, our goal is to 
             reward all project supporters at the start with big payouts and use thus viral marketing, which 
             uniswap, 1inch, gods unchained and other projects used, in return we will 
             get traffic and users, practice showed that for working 
             products this is good strategy.  But please understand we are not promising anything specifically, it all depends 
             on what funds will invest in us in the early stages of pre-sales
             and other factors when choosing a development 
             strategy for the project, now we are looking for and negotiating strategic partnerships, anyway, our main goal is 
             to pay those who work on the web-site, our community and we are one team.
            After the listings, the points accumulated for each month of your work, we will sum up in % ratio and pay catch 
            tokens earned for the previous month, we will take tokens CATCH from the sale of advertising and other services 
            on the web-site (as well as for a good start, probably put additional rewards in tokenomics), after the payment 
            of tokens once a month points will be reset.
            ATTENTION, IF YOU DO NOT VISIT THE WEB-SITE, THE POINTS WILL BE TAKEN AWAY. l be a ranking system on the web-site, maybe we will give all early and active users 
            high ranks after listing, the higher your rank the higher the payout of CATCH tokens. Also, if 
            you have a high rank you will be able to get tickets to participate in public sales on our 
            CATCHPAD Launchpad.

        <p>When adding a token or adding an event on the main page of the web-site, the user can add their 
        referral link in any section of the token or report that the event is over, as well as to vote

        <p>In addition to the ability to add referral links to any section of the project, users get CATCH 
        points for the above activities on the web-site. In case the web-site works perfectly after the 
        testnet and listing, catch points at the end of each month will be exchanged to CATCH tokens, 
        catch tokens will be taken from the sale of services on the web-site. The more catch points you 
        accumulate, the higher your account rank will be, the higher your account rank, the higher the

        <p>'Filters' - remove filters<br>
        'Show Tooltips' - remove the description of filters and buttons</p>
        <p>'NoN' - is to exclude all events in the column</p>
        <p>'TOP Events' - are potentially the most profitable events of the project according to our analysts.</p>
        <p>'Added days' - with this filter, we can expose fresh, added or edited tokens or their events, attention any editing by the moderator of a token, even deleting a past event, 
        will give you the token as freshly edited for today as it is added.</p>
        <p>'Category' - filter by category of projects defi, games, exchanges, etc.</p>
        <p>'Whitelist' - whitelisting filter for TOKEN or NFT presales, select the presale you are interested in</p>
        <p>'Airdrop' - NFT or TOKEN distribution filter</p>
        <p>
        'Bounty' - project promotion, for influencers and creative people, you can help the project in promotion: 
        shoot videos, write articles, make posts, draw design pictures FREE filter means that you will receive free tokens for promotion and help to 
        the project without any checks on the quality of the content of the project, usually such bounties take place on bitcointalk forum website in 
        the bounty section, through the admins of the forum.
        </p>
        <p>AMBASSADOR filter means that the project itself conducts a set of Influencers and other participants of the company, checks all the content 
        itself, here the quality of the content is very high, in most cases, tokens are paid FREE for helping the project, in rare cases it is allocation
        </p>
        <p>ALLOCATION filter means that you promote the project for the opportunity to buy tokens on presale, as a rule, it is the top projects, 
        which select the best major Influencers.
        </p>
        <p>
        'Testnet' - at the presale stage, all projects need to have their product tested, its availability, 
        fix bugs, adjust operation, for the help of testing, usually product creators of the project can pay a decent amount after listing on the exchanges.
        </p>
        <p>TESTNET filter is network testing with a created node, usually by POS technology, something like more modern mining, there are instructions on 
        how to launch the NODE and maintain the network in the description or via the link. Usually projects give free test-tokens to test the platform, 
        then after listing they pay real tokens for testing the network.
        </p>
        <p>DEFI filter is SWAP testing, cross-chain bridge testing, and any other DEFI related tests.</p>
        <p>GAME filter is testing a demo or alpha version of a game to get paid.</p>
        <p>APP filter testing of programs or crypto applications.</p>
        <p>SITE filter testing all possible functions of a crypto project's web-site.</p>
        <p>Filter Masternode launching of a working node - the project node (mainnet) 
        to process a blockchain network, for the node we get reward in % of token uploaded to exchanges (in the future we will connect via api and get the actual data on %).

        <p>
          VOTES takes into account the % of likes and dislikes, so new projects can easily make it to the top (% entry is affected by the emoji column, if the project has top 
          foundations and celebrities in the team it is easier to get a high %, but if the projects is suspected to be a scam the weight of dislikes will be much higher) now

        Get from 100 to 10 000 points per video (depends on views), according to our estimates it is about $10-$100, 
        but this is rough and not accurate, since we are now making strategic partnerships and in the process of making 
        our tokenomics and plans, but as we said we believe that giving out large sums at the start of the project like
        UNISWAP, 1INCH, GODS UNCHAINED will give viral marketing and coverage. But we can not promise anything for 100%, 
        the marketing strategy and tokenomics are in development so the payouts may be much lower, or much higher than announced.<br>
